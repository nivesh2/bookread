# That will never work.

## 1. Against Epiphanies

Origin stories often hinge on epiphanies. Travis Kalanick spends $800 on a private driver on New Year's Eve and thinks there has to be a cheaper way - that's Uber.

There's a popular story about Netflix that says the idea came to Reed after he's rung up a $40 late fee on Apollo13 at Blockbuster. He thought, What if there were no late fees? And BOOM! The idea for Netflix was born.

That story is beautiful. It's useful. It is, as we say in marketing, emotionally true.

Epiphanies are rare. We like these tales beacuse they align with a romantic idea about inspiration and genius. We want our Isaac Newtons to be sitting under the apple tree when the apple fallls. We want Archimedes in his bathtub.
But the truth is usually more complicated than that. That truth is for every good idea,there are a thousand bad ones. And sometimes it can be hard to tell the truth.

## 2. That will Never Work

A piece of advice.

> If you want to build an estate, own your own business. Control your life.

I'd spent years working in marketing for other people, at large corps & small startups alke. But, always wondered what its like to build a company from the ground up, complete solo - if it would be more fulfulling if the problems I solved were my problems. That, after all, was what my father was telling me, hammer in hand.

Personalized surfboads, customized shampoo, customized dog food.
"Videotapes?" 
- "That's gonna be expensive"
- "Who wants to wait a week to watch Sleepless in Seattle?"
"Back to the drawing board", I said, eraser in hand.

## 3. Please, Mr. POSTMAN

In Silicon Valley, tech talent is the scarcest resource, and an unknown fledging company can have a hard time attracting top employees.

Most business plans - with their exhaustive go-to-market strategies, detailed projections of revenue and expenses, and optimistic forecasts of market share - are a complete waste of time. They become obsolete the minute the business starts and you relize how wildly off the mark you were with all your expectations.

The truth is that no business plan survies a collision with a real customer. So the tirck is to take your idea and set it on a collision course with reality as soon as possible.

We felt like pioneers on the eve of a great expedition. There was enough land for everyone.
